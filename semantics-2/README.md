Mathpartir is a useful LaTeX package for typesetting proofs. To see how to
write some inference rules, compile the example `mathpartir.tex` with, e.g.,
`pdflatex`. To use it for your assignment, include `mathpartir.sty` in your tex
file (i.e., (`\usepackage {mathpartir}`).  Alternatively, you can also modify
`mathpartir.tex` directly.
